# Demand Forecasting for Car Sales in Norway using Machine Learning algorithms
In this project, we harness the power of machine learning algorithms to predict the future demand and gain valuable insights into the ever-evolving automotive market.

For this, we will use publicly avaialble Norway car sales data. The dataset captures information about car sales in Norway, including the specific make of cars, the quantity sold, and the corresponding percentages. Beginning with meticulous data preprocessing, I transform raw information into a structured format, allowing for meaningful analysis.

I employed the Decision Tree Regressor to extract insights from historical patterns and predict future car sales and evaluated my model based on the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) metric. Further, to enhance accuracy, I explored the Random Forest Regressor. This advanced technique, combining multiple decision trees, yielded even lower MAE. Thorough evaluation and comparison confirmed the Random Forest Regressor's superiority in capturing the complexities of car sales dynamics.
